setup:

1) install + setup go
2) set go path. For me it is: export GOPATH=$HOME/Documents/OpinionDuelsNews/scraper
3) set path. For me it is: export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
4) can go ahead and goinstall from there 


TODO:

List of things to work on for the scraper ( in addition to testing, refactoring etc)

Getting articles -- general outline is done, need to add more news sources though
Scheduling article requests
Storing articles
Error handling

Secondary things to add: 
Spoofing IP, user agent etc. to make it harder to stop the scraping
Getting pages with pretty HTML
